# Visualizing machine understanding of human emotion

Authors: Mariana Villamizar & Shih-Po Lee

Have you ever wondered how machines understand images and detect features in
them? How can a machine detect the emotion that is being shown in an image? With
this short narrative piece, we visually explore the concepts and data structures
involved in the process of using convolutional neural networks to identify
emotions in pictures of human faces.

This project was made with Svelte and D3.js

To run:
